# gravity

```go
import "go.pitz.tech/units/gravity"
```

## Usage

```go
const (
	// EarthSI provides a constant value that represents the acceleration due to Earths gravity using international
	// standard units (i.e. 9.806 m/(s^2)).
	EarthSI = 9.806

	// EarthImperial provides a constant value that represents the acceleration due to Earths gravity using Imperial units
	// (i.e. 32.174 ft/(s^2)).
	EarthImperial = 32.174
)
```
