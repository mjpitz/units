// Package units offers shared code for handling standard units of measurement. It takes inspiration from Golang's time
// library and applies similar ideas to other units of measure. This is achieved through a common declaration called a
// Unit, which organizes measurements in increasing order, often derived from a base unit. A Unit also facilitates
// parsing and formatting of measurements to improve computer use and human readability (respectively). To get a better
// understanding of its functioning, you can explore the provided packages for more specific information.
